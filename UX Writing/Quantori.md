# Intro

Qunatori develops software for life scientists and bioengineers. The biggest challenge for me as a UX writer was avoiding unnecessary complexity in an already dense interface while ensuring consistency in terminology that aligns with the company's and domain standards.

To address this, I introduced a [writing style guide](https://github.com/indrajiita/test/edit/main/Technical%20Writing/writing_style_guide.md) and project-specific glossaries. Also, I made interfaces more intuitive, reducing the need for users to rely on documentation.

    <td valign="top">The mix of title case, sentence case, and all caps makes it harder for users to scan the interface quickly.</td>
    <td valign="top">The improved version applies consistent capitalization:<ul><li>Sentence case is used for most UI elements.</li><li>All caps is applied to <b>PINNED COLUMNS</b> to distinguish the label from column names, which remain in sentence case.</li></ul></td>
