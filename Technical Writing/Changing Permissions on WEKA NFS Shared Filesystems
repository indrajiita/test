# Scope
This procedure outlines the steps required to change the NFS permissions on a WEKA filesystem in an HPC cluster, allowing for access from non-cluster nodes (for example, cloud instances).

# Procedure

## Justification
It may be necessary to grant access to shared filesystems on non-cluster nodes. By default, the NFS protocol restricts access to unknown hosts or networks, blocking these systems from mounting shares. This process ensures that the necessary permissions are granted.

## Communication Plan
Not required as the process does not involve service interruption.

## Implementation Plan
There are two methods to modify permissions in WEKA: using the **GUI** or the **CLI**.

### Method 1: Using the GUI
1. Access the WEKA GUI: [http://weka.sample.com:14001/ui](http://weka.sample.com:14001/ui).
2. Log in with your ADM account.
3. Go to **Manage > Protocols**.<br><img src="https://github.com/indrajiita/test/blob/main/Technical%20Writing/media1/Weka1.png?raw=true" width="500">
4. On the sidebar, select **NFS** and click **Permissions**.<br><img src="https://github.com/indrajiita/test/blob/main/Technical%20Writing/media1/Weka2.png?raw=true" width="500">
5. Since clients are not separated into groups, all clients are listed under the **sample-cluster** group.
6. Click on either **Add DNS** or **Add IP**, depending on your requirements.<br><img src="https://github.com/indrajiita/test/blob/main/Technical%20Writing/media1/Weka3.png?raw=true" width="500">
7. Complete the form with the appropriate **hostname or IP address**. Ensure the correct **network mask** is set if adding a network.
8. Click **Save**.
9. Verify that the changes have been applied by reviewing the updated list of clients.

### Method 2: Using the CLI
1. SSH into any WEKA node with an ADM account:
   ```bash
   ssh sample-weka-node-001
   ```
2. Log into WEKA CLI:
   ```bash
   weka user login
   ```
3. Enter your **ADM username and password** when prompted.
4. Depending on your requirements, use one of the following commands to add a new client or network:

   **Add by DNS:**
   ```bash
   weka nfs rules add dns sample-cluster client-hostname
   ```

   **Add by IP:**
   ```bash
   weka nfs rules add ip sample-cluster 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0
   ```

5. Confirm that the new client or network has been added. Run either of the following commands:

   **For DNS:**
   ```bash
   weka nfs client-group | grep client-hostname
   ```

   **For IP:**
   ```bash
   weka nfs client-group | grep client-ip
   ```
