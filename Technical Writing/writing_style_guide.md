## [Why a style guide is important?](#why-style-guide-is-important)

Every content contributor has their own style, voice, and preferences. However, we all enjoy using apps that communicate with us consistently, clearly, and effectively. A style guide is one of the means to build the foundation of a solid user experience across the company's products.

Also, UX writing doesn't always follow the language rules perfectly—effectiveness comes before grammar. A style guide helps you to define the boundaries of your grammar flexibility and save time arguing with your reviewers over a comma or a word choice.

And last but not least, style guides help you to save time by settling down arguments with your fellow coworkers over a comma or a word choice.

## [Using other style guides](#using-other-style-guides)

Clients' style guides always take precedence over this guide. When there's a conflict, follow the client's guide. For unresolved questions, [contact Andrew Orlov](mailto:andrey.orlov.ru@gmail.com).

## [Communication with users](#communication-with-users)

### [Addressing the user](#addressing-the-user)

Even though an app might have thousands of users, its interface communicates with the current one.

- Write as if speaking directly to the user ("you," "your," "yours").
- To let the user tell the app what to do, write from the user's perspective ("I," "me," "my").
- Use "we," "our," and "us" when you write on behalf of Hightech Corp. It makes UX more personal.
- Use active voice in most cases. For details, see [Voice](#voice).
- Use gender-neutral pronouns ("they," "their," and "them") or rewrite sentences.

| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Remind you later                         | Remind me later                         | The user tells the app what to do.          |
| A confirmation email will be sent        | We will send you a confirmation email   | Address the user on behalf of Hightech Corp. Use active voice. |
| A user can save his or her files to your shared folder. | A user can save their files to your shared folder. | Use gender-neutral pronouns.                |


### [Tone](#tone)

Cultivate the following tone:

- User-oriented: Focus on real tasks, not features.
- Helpful: Don't make your users guess. Often, they may guess wrong. Make your interface clear and as close to the use cases as possible so the user does not need to look things up in the documentation.
- Friendly: Avoid overly formal or mentoring language.
- Concise: User attention focuses on the first few words of your message or label. Capture user attention with clear, short messages.
- Humble: Never blame users for errors. If the app fails to do something, admit it.

### [Using "please"](#using-please)

Overusing "please" in a text can have a negative impact, adding length and robbing it of confidence.

Don't  use "please":

- To make your text more polite in general. Instead, be polite by writing concisely and saving
time.
- When guiding users through the app. You're not begging them to "click the button." You're providing them with valuable instructions.

Use "please":

- When asking a user for a favor or something inconvenient: "Please leave us feedback."
- When something goes wrong and the user is not to be blamed for it. Like app crashes or server downtime.

| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Please click [this link]() for more information.    | [Learn more]().                                  | Save users time. That's true politeness.           |
| Please select a file to upload                  | Select a file to upload                      | You're not asking the user, you're providing an instruction. |
| Take a survey.                                  | Please take a few minutes to fill out our survey. | Users don't need your survey. You need it. Ask politely. |


## [Grammar](#grammar)

### [Tenses](#tenses)

Users don't read; they scan. Simple tenses are the best choice for most content—they are easier to read and understand.

- In most cases, use present simple.
- Use future simple to describe scheduled or upcoming events. Avoid using the future tense to describe the way the product always behaves.
- Use present continuous to emphasize that something is taking place right now. Especially when the user needs to wait till something is over.

| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------- |
| File has been saved                            | File is saved                                  | Simple tense is more concise while still conveying the meaning. |
| File will be downloaded soon                   | Downloading the file…                          | The user needs to wait till the download is over.          |
| We notify you 5 days before your subscription expires | We will notify you 5 days before your subscription expires | Use the future simple tense for upcoming events.           |

### [Articles](#articles)

Despite English grammar rules, interfaces don't use articles much.

- Omit articles in UI labels and short tooltips and error messages.
- Use articles in longer sentences to make them sound human and friendly.
- Always use an article when omitting it could lead to ambiguity.

| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Save the file             | Save file                   | Short messages don't require the leading article.|
| The file is not found     | File not found              | Short messages don't require the leading article.|
| Change form               | The change form<br>Change the form | Use the article to remove ambiguity.           |

### [Voice](#voice)

In general, use active voice: it is direct, engaging, and usually easier to read.

Passive voice neglects who or what is performing an action, which can make sentences confusing. However, there are exceptions. Use passive voice in the following cases:

- To avoid blaming the user, especially in errors, warnings, or notifications.
- To avoid awkward constructions.
- If the message subject is unknown or irrelevant.

| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| The ZIP file must be downloaded   | Download the ZIP file         | Make it clear who should perform the action.  |
| You created over 50 conflicts     | Over 50 conflicts were found | Don't blame the user.                         |
| Someone deleted the file          | File was deleted              | It's irrelevant who did that.                 |

## [Punctuation](#punctuation)

### [Oxford comma](#oxford-comma)

Always use the Oxford comma. It helps to avoid confusion by signaling a list of items.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>ℹ️ INFO:</strong> The Oxford comma comes before the conjunction in a list of three or more items.
      <br>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| The update affects dummy users, administrators and guests. | The update affects dummy users, administrators, and guests. | Without the comma, administrators and guests could be interpreted as dummy users. |

### [End punctuation](#end-punctuation)

To help readers scan text at a glance, avoid using end punctuation in places where it  unnecessary.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>ℹ️ INFO:</strong> End punctuation includes the period, question mark, and exclamation mark.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

- Avoid periods in headings, UI labels, and simple lists (three or fewer words per list item).
- Use periods in multi-sentence tooltips and dialogs.
- Avoid exclamation points, as they can be invasive and distracting. Use them sparingly in greetings (Welcome!) and to call attention to the content (New!).

| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Save the draft to finish later.                       | Save the draft to finish later                      | A single-sentence tooltip. No end punctuation is required. |
| Save the draft to finish later. Set a reminder to do it on time | Save the draft to finish later. Set a reminder to do it on time. | A multiple-sentence tooltip. End punctuation is required.  |
| Copy is created!                                      | Copy is created                                     | Don't overuse exclamation marks.                          |


### [Quotation marks](#quotation-marks)

Use quotation marks for:

- Direct quotes.<br>`As Kurt Vonnegut once said: "Science is magic that works."`
- Titles of essays, lectures, or articles.<br>`For more information, read "Rapid AAV Titer for Bioprocessing in Gene Therapy."`
- Figurative or indirect meanings.<br>`The press mentions a "black hole" in the UK's public finances.`
- Discussing a word or letter.<br>`The "h" in "chemistry" is silent.`

Don’t  use quotation marks to:

- Enclose the titles of books or films. Instead, use _italics_.
- Indicate code identifiers and keywords. Instead, use `code` formatting.

In most cases, use double straight quotation marks ( " " ). Use single straight quotation marks ( ' ' ) when nesting a quotation inside another
quotation.

Don't use curly quotation marks ( “ ” ) or guillemets ( « » ).

Place commas and periods before closing quotation marks. Place other punctuation after closing quotation marks (except when the punctuation is part of the quote).

| ❌ **Don't**                                       | ✔️ **Do**                                       | **Comment**                                        |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| CRISPR/Cas9 scissors cut DNA at the specified location. | CRISPR/Cas9 "scissors" cut DNA at the specified location. | Quote words used in their indirect meaning. |
|Could not means that the attempt to do something failed.|"Could not" means that the attempt to do something failed.|Quote the phrase that you are talking about.|
| Run the "format" command to auto-format your code. | Run the `format` command to auto-format your code. | Use code formatting for keywords and identifiers. |
